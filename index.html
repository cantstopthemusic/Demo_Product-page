        There’s a vibe at skydiving dropzones – you can feel it. People come to
        the sport for a multitude of reasons. Some were seemingly born with a
        thrill-seeking gene, others jump for reclamation, release, rejuvenation.
        Whatever the draw, the energy around the DZ is palpable and the
        community that forms around it is irreplaceable. And regardless of
        whether you jump once or become a bonafide canopy pilot, you’re part of
        it.
      </p>
      <p id="des2">
        When you jump into the big blue from 13,500 feet above the ground,
        something deep down awakens and in an instant, everything feels
        different. Not only are you flying through the sky at 120 mph – a
        physical sensation that can’t be accomplished any other way – but you’re
        also bathing your brain in a powerful mix of adrenaline, serotonin, and
        dopamine that allow you reap emotional and spiritual rewards that put
        mega pep in your step.
      </p>
      <p id="des3">
        Wake up. Be responsible and productive all day. Go to bed. Rinse,
        repeat. Adulting can be rough. When you intentionally usher adventure
        into your life, you experience a surge that can embolden you to try
        other things that previously felt unattainable or even a little crazy.
        You not only embrace the notion of I CAN! within yourself, but you also
        discover your spirit of AND I WILL!
